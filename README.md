# XML-Parser
Best xml editor from scratch

## Abstract
 XML format was the first used to transfer data via the internet during its early day. Though, it's still cruical to master these concepts which explains how the web really works. Now, its predesessor JSON used extensively and enabled the new efficient RESTful APIs which expanded web services in the way we know today.
In this project we aim to understand the different formats used in the web by making our own application manipulating these different kinds of data.

## Goals
 To build a GUI application able to: 
 - Correct xml files.
 - Format and Identation.
 - Convert xml files into JSON.
 - Reducing file size by removing extra spaces.
 - compress the file to reduce its size.

## Background
XML files is common format to transfer data across the internet gained its popularity in the early days of the web due to the vast similarity with HTML syntax. Now, a better alternative is JSON format which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. both of these formats are used to send data in HTTP requests.
Due to the similarity with HTML we will adopt the DOM - Document Object Model - model used in modern browsers by parsing the file as a tree and applying different operations as needed by the user.
